//In Java, the term "3-layer architecture" typically refers to a software architecture pattern used to organize the components and functionality of an application into three distinct layers: Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer. Each layer serves a specific purpose and encapsulates related functionality. Here's an explanation of each layer and some common classes you might find in each:
//
//Presentation Layer:
//
//The Presentation Layer is responsible for handling user interactions and presenting data to the user.
//It consists of user interfaces (UI) and user interface logic.
//Common classes in the Presentation Layer:
//User Interface Components: Classes representing various UI elements such as forms, buttons, labels, and text fields.
//Controller Classes: These classes handle user input and orchestrate communication between the UI and the Business Logic Layer.
//View Classes: Responsible for displaying data to the user and handling the rendering of UI elements.
//DTO (Data Transfer Objects): Used to transfer data between the Presentation Layer and the Business Logic Layer.
//Business Logic Layer:
//
//The Business Logic Layer contains the core application logic and rules.
//It processes and manipulates data received from the Presentation Layer and prepares it for storage or retrieval in the Data Access Layer.
//Common classes in the Business Logic Layer:
//Service Classes: These classes implement business logic and are responsible for processing data and performing operations.
//Domain Model Classes: Represent the core data structures and entities used by the application.
//Business Logic Components: Custom classes that implement various business rules and algorithms.
//Data Access Layer:
//
//The Data Access Layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any other data storage system.
//It abstracts the details of data storage and retrieval, providing a standardized interface for the Business Logic Layer.
//Common classes in the Data Access Layer:
//Repository Classes: These classes encapsulate database operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
//Data Access Objects (DAOs): Interfaces or classes that define the contract for data access operations.
//Database Connection Manager: A class responsible for managing database connections and transactions.
//In a well-structured application following the 3-layer architecture, each layer should have a clear separation of concerns. The Presentation Layer deals with user interactions, the Business Logic Layer handles application logic, and the Data Access Layer manages data storage and retrieval. This separation makes the application more maintainable, scalable, and testable.
//
//It's important to note that while this architecture provides a useful separation of concerns, the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and technologies used in a Java application. Frameworks like Spring and Java EE provide tools and patterns to help implement these layers effectively.
